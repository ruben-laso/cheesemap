# Contributing

You are welcome to contribute to this project, just be nice and try to follow the guidelines below.

We try to use the convention of [conventionalcommits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages.
E.g.:

```

We also try to use `clang-format` to format your code, and `clang-tidy` to check for common mistakes.
